# A method named `binary_to_decimal` that receives as input an array of size 8.
# The array is randomly filled with 0’s and 1’s.
# The most significant bit is at index 0.
# The least significant bit is at index 7.
# Calculate  and return the decimal value for this binary number using
# the algorithm you devised in class.

      product = digit.to_i * (2**j)
      j -= 1
      decimal = decimal.to_i + product.to_i
